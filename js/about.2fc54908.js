Whether it be user guides, API documentation, or GitHub wiki, technical documentation helps the user find an answer to any question they may have about an application or software. Technical documentation provides efficiency and clarity, and it is absolutely necessary when providing a quality product."},{id:4,bio:"Some of my interests include video games, exercising, and traveling. I have dabbled a bit in game development, which you can check out in the Projects section of my portfolio. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is paramount, especially when my career consists of sitting at a desk a significant amount of the day. It's important to keep track of your health so you can always bring the best version of yourself to work. My passion for travel goes hand in hand with my pursuit of inspiration. Venturing to new destinations helps to expand my perspectives, as well as ignites ideas for potential future side projects. Being able to experience diverse cultures and landscapes continually fuels my creative aspirations."}]}}},p=a(744);const g=(0,p.Z)(u,[["render",m]]);var f=g;const h={class:"mt-10 sm:mt-20 bg-primary-light dark:bg-ternary-dark shadow-sm"},y={class:"font-general-regular container mx-auto py-20 block sm:flex sm:justify-between sm:items-center"},b={class:"mb-20 sm:mb-0"},v=(0,n._)("div",{class:"font-general-medium text-4xl font-bold text-secondary-dark dark:text-secondary-light mb-2"}," Program Alumni ",-1),w={class:"block text-md text-ternary-dark dark:text-ternary-light"},k={class:"mb-20 sm:mb-0"},x=(0,n._)("div",{class:"font-general-medium text-4xl font-bold text-secondary-dark dark:text-secondary-light mb-2"}," B.S. in Computer Science ",-1),_={class:"block text-md text-ternary-dark dark:text-ternary-light"},I={class:"mb-20 sm:mb-0"},T=(0,n._)("div",{class:"font-general-medium text-4xl font-bold text-secondary-dark dark:text-secondary-light mb-2"}," Award Recipient ",-1),A={class:"block text-md text-ternary-dark dark:text-ternary-light"};function D(e,t,a,i,o,s){return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)("div",h,[(0,n._)("div",y,[(0,n._)("div",b,[v,(0,n._)("span",w,(0,r.zw)(e.alumniTitle),1)]),(0,n._)("div",k,[x,(0,n._)("span",_,(0,r.zw)(e.degreeTitle),1)]),(0,n._)("div",I,[T,(0,n._)("span",A,(0,r.zw)(e.trophyTitle),1)])])])}var M={data:()=>({degreeTitle:"from California State University, Los Angeles",alumniTitle:"of STEM Advantage",trophyTitle:"of the VGM Traveling Trophy"})};const S=(0,p.Z)(M,[["render",D]]);var G=S,C=a(508),P=a.n(C),V={name:"About",components:{AboutMe:f,AboutInfo:G},data:()=>({}),mounted(){P().replace()},updated(){P().replace()},methods:{}};const W=(0,p.Z)(V,[["render",o]]);var j=W}}]);
